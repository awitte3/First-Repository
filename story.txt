Today's social-distancing-compliant jog was a surprisingly eventful one. I usually start in my neighborhood, pass by the new school being constructed, and return
along the main shopping street near my home. As always, I started with some stretches. A tone was set when a gust of wind blew the newly coloring leaves from 
the tree I was next to directly into my face. At least they looked pretty. As I was just starting my jog, I noticed that a man was sitting on the porch of a 
house ahead of me. As I approached I noticed he was playing a guitar and singing a soft song I couldn't recognize. We had a short, but pleasant interaction as I 
passed by him. It was nice to see such a simple activity when the world seems so crazy. Unfortunately the relative peace of my jog was about to be broken as I
approached the school construction site...

Sounds of jackhammers desecrating the much loved sidewalks which I am now unable to walk on, a bombardment of hammers into fresh cut lumber, and not to mention workmen shouting at the top of their lungs to one another in a attempt to convey some sort of information.  This appeared to be a failed attempt though since the ping pong match of shouting never seized.  It almost seemed the two of them had gotten into a fight, but both of them spoke different languages so they could never get the point across that they wanted to make.  As I continued to walk down the road, the sounds of the construction site began to fade in the distance and the blissful peace began to return, feeling similar to having a severe migraine finally disappear.  

While the incident was rather annoying, I did find the change of to my usual mundane pandemic life welcoming. Pretty ironic provided in normal times this incident would have ruined my jog and subsequently my day. To me seeing the construction site so lively, energetic and rather loud was a step back into a pre pandemic time and also indicative of how are things slowly but surely coming back to how it was.
