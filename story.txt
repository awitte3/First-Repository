Today's social-distancing-compliant jog was a surprisingly eventful one. I usually start in my neighborhood, pass by the new school being constructed, and return
along the main shopping street near my home. As always, I started with some stretches. A tone was set when a gust of wind blew the newly coloring leaves from 
the tree I was next to directly into my face. At least they looked pretty. As I was just starting my jog, I noticed that a man was sitting on the porch of a 
house ahead of me. As I approached I noticed he was playing a guitar and singing a soft song I couldn't recognize. We had a short, but pleasant interaction as I 
passed by him. It was nice to see such a simple activity when the world seems so crazy. Unfortunately the relative peace of my jog was about to be broken as I
approached the school construction site...
